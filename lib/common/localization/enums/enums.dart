At TrueMatch, we respect and protect the privacy of our users. When you use our app, we collect certain information to improve your experience and provide matchmaking services tailored to your preferences. This includes details you provide such as your name, email address, gender, photos, bio, and dating preferences. We also collect data about your activity within the app, such as the profiles you view, messages you send, and other interactions, along with technical data like device type, location (if enabled), and usage statistics.

Your information helps us personalize recommendations, improve our features, maintain the security of our platform, and ensure your experience is safe and enjoyable. Some information, such as profile data, may be shared with other users to facilitate matches. We also work with trusted third-party providers for hosting, analytics, and payment processing; however, we never sell your personal data to advertisers or outside entities.

You are always in control of your data. You can update or delete your profile, disable location sharing, and even request account deletion at any time. TrueMatch uses secure technologies to protect your information, including encryption and regular security checks, but we also encourage users to take personal precautions such as safeguarding login credentials.

By using our app, you agree to this privacy policy and any future updates we may apply. If changes are made to how we handle your data, we’ll notify you through the app or email.
